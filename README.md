This project--like the tic tac toe project--I coded locally before making a repository.

The javascript in this project seemingly helped me a lot in progressing my understanding in javascript. Furthermore, I feel that my CSS is coming up to par (which I believe I was lacking). Regardless, about the project.

This project is a "library" that accepts user input -> creates the input into an object -> stores the object in an array -> and display the contents in the array on screen. That's basically it. I'm actually quite proud of the way that it has turned out, and I gained a good amount of knowledge and familiarity with DOM Manipulation! This was spectacular!
